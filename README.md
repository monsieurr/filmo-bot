# Twitter Filmobot

## Description
A twitter bot posting nice curated movie screenshots.
This project is using Python and Tweepy to handle the communication with the twitter API.
Hosted on Heroku and running with the Heroku Scheduler addon.

## Other twitter bots I made
- [twitter-arti-bot](https://github.com/monsieurr/twitter-arti-bot) : posts photos each day, curated from my collection.
- [motbot](https://github.com/monsieurr/motbot) : posts a different quote in french with a random coloured background each day.
- [color-bot](https://github.com/monsieurr/color-bot) : posts a set of 4 random colors each day, very simple but probably my favourite.
